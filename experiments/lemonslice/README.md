```

The agent will start and connect to your LiveKit server.

### Frontend setup

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```

4. Select a boss personality and start practicing

## Boss personalities

The agent includes three distinct boss types to practice with:

### The Encourager (Easy)
- Supportive and open to discussion
- Responds positively to clear value demonstrations
- Good for building confidence and learning the basics

### The Skeptic (Medium)
- Questions your reasoning and assumptions
- Challenges you to defend your worth
- Pushes back on numbers and justifications
- Good for preparing difficult conversations

### The Busy Executive (Hard)
- Impatient and time-constrained
- Values conciseness and directness
- Needs quick, compelling arguments
- Good for practicing elevator pitch style requests

## How it works

### Session flow

1. **Select a boss**: Choose your difficulty level from the welcome screen
2. **Role-play mode**: The AI boss engages in a salary negotiation conversation
3. **Coaching mode**: Click "How am I doing?" to pause and get feedback from the coach
4. **Return to practice**: The coach will guide you back to continue the conversation
5. **Wrap-up**: After 3 minutes, the session automatically ends

### Coaching features

During coaching mode, the agent provides specific feedback on your negotiation approach, including what's working well and areas to improve. The coaching is contextual based on the conversation so far.
